## Landing Page Enhancement Strategy

**Date Created:** 2025-10-09
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-10
**Test URL:** http://localhost:3000/landingpage-path/CT?test=true
**Target File:** `public/js/simple-landing-page-google.js`

---

## üìã Phase 1 Status (Updated 2025-10-10)

**Completed:** 5/7 tasks ‚úÖ
**Deferred:** 2/7 tasks ‚è∏Ô∏è (pending API updates)

### ‚úÖ Working
- LocalBusiness @type
- additionalType (business classification)
- postalCode (fixed)
- hasMap (Google Maps link)
- description
- areaServed

### ‚è∏Ô∏è Pending API Data
- **aggregateRating**: Requires `store.reviews[]` array in API response
- **parentOrganization**: Requires `store.brandUrl`, `store.brandLogo`, `store.brandSocialMedia[]`

**Schema Validation:** ‚úÖ PASSED (Schema.org Validator: 0 errors, 0 warnings)

---

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to optimize the PinMeTo landing page for Local SEO and AI Overviews (AIO). The current implementation has basic structured data but is missing critical properties that would significantly improve visibility in local search results and AI-generated summaries.

---

## Current State Analysis

### ‚úÖ What's Working Well

- Basic Schema.org Store structured data present
- Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags implemented
- Canonical URL set
- BreadcrumbList structured data
- Opening hours in structured data
- Geographic coordinates (lat/long) included
- Social media links in `sameAs` property
- Reviews displayed on page

### ‚ùå Critical Issues Found

#### 1. Schema.org Issues (High Priority)

**Problem:** Using wrong @type
- Currently: `"@type": "Store"`
- Should be: `"@type": "LocalBusiness"` for better local SEO
- Rationale: LocalBusiness is more specific and preferred by Google for local search

**Missing Critical LocalBusiness Properties:**
- `priceRange` - Helps AI understand affordability (e.g., "$$", "$$$")
- `areaServed` - Defines service area (city, region, country)
- `aggregateRating` - Reviews exist but not aggregated in structured data
- `hasMap` - Direct link to Google Maps location
- `paymentAccepted` - Important for local search (e.g., "Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card")
- `currenciesAccepted` - Currency information (e.g., "PLN", "EUR")
- `additionalType` - More specific business classification
- `about` - Concise business description for AI summaries

**Data Quality Issues:**
- Postal code empty in structured data (shows "" instead of "72-600")
- No parent Organization/brand structure
- Reviews not marked up with Review schema

**Location:** `simple-landing-page-google.js:649-669`

---

#### 2. NAP (Name, Address, Phone) Consistency

**Phone Formatting Issue:**
- Display: "85 585 58 55"
- Tel link: `tel:855855855` (all spaces removed)
- Problem: Inconsistent formatting may confuse search engines
- Solution: Standardize to international format with proper tel: link

**Postal Code Missing:**
- UI displays: "72-600"
- Structured data: `postalCode: ""`
- Impact: Critical NAP signal missing from schema

**Location:** Check data mapping from API response to structured data

---

#### 3. AIO (AI Overviews) Optimization Issues

**Missing FAQ Schema:**
- No Q&A structured data
- Impact: AI Overviews often pull from FAQPage schema
- Opportunity: Add common questions (hours, location, services, parking, etc.)

**No Category/Business Type:**
- Missing detailed business classification
- Should include: industry, business type, specializations
- Example: Electronics store, appliances, home entertainment

**Weak Description:**
- Current: Generic corporate description
- Needed: Location-specific description with local keywords
- Should include: Neighborhood, landmarks, unique offerings, local context

**Missing Service/Product Schema:**
- No detailed offerings in structured data
- Opportunity: List main product categories or services
- Helps AI understand what business offers

**No "speakable" Markup:**
- Missing voice search optimization
- WebPage schema with speakable sections helps voice assistants

---

#### 4. Meta Tags & SEO

**Language Mismatch:**
- HTML: `<html lang="sv">` (Swedish)
- Content: Polish (store in Poland, Polish description)
- Impact: Confuses search engines and may affect rankings
- Fix: Detect language from store location or API data

**Missing hreflang Tags:**
- No multi-language support markup
- If same store has pages in multiple languages, need hreflang
- Important for international businesses

**Generic Image Fallback:**
- Using: `http://localhost:3000/images/store-default.jpg`
- Should use: Actual store photo from API data
- Impact: Rich snippets less appealing without real images

**Title Optimization:**
- Current: "RTV EURO AGD ‚Äì ≈öwinouj≈õcie | Opening Hours, Address & Contact"
- Good: Includes city and store name
- Could improve: Add unique selling proposition or category
- Example: "RTV EURO AGD ‚Äì Electronics & Appliances in ≈öwinouj≈õcie | Opening Hours"

**Location:** `simple-landing-page-google.js:634-645`

---

#### 5. Content & UX for AIO

**Business Hours Statement:**
- Current: Just list format
- Better: Add natural language statement
- Example: "Open Monday-Saturday 9am-8pm, Sunday 10am-6pm"
- Helps AI extract and summarize hours

**Missing Accessibility:**
- Review star ratings lack aria-labels
- Important for screen readers and semantic understanding

**No "About" Section:**
- AI crawlers prefer clear, dedicated sections
- Should have: Business description, history, specializations
- Currently: Only description in meta tags, not visible content

**Review Schema Missing:**
- Reviews displayed but not in structured data
- Should use: Individual Review schema with itemReviewed
- Helps: Star ratings appear in search results

---

## üéØ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Critical Schema.org Fixes ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Priority:** Highest - Foundation for all local SEO
**Estimated Impact:** 30-40% improvement in local search visibility
**Time Estimate:** 2-3 hours

#### Tasks:

- [x] **1. Change @type from "Store" to "LocalBusiness"** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-09)
  - File: `simple-landing-page-google.js:666`
  - Change: `"@type": "Store"` ‚Üí `"@type": "LocalBusiness"`
  - Test: Validate with Google's Rich Results Test

- [x] **2. Add detailed business type using additionalType** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-09)
  - Add property: `"additionalType": "http://www.productontology.org/id/Electronics_store"`
  - Or use categories from API data if available
  - Example: "Electronics Store", "Appliance Store", "Home Entertainment"
  - **Implementation:** Extracts from `store.network.google.categories.primaryCategory.name` with fallbacks

- [x] **3. Fix postal code in structured data** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-09)
  - Current: `postalCode: ""`
  - Fix: Ensure postal code from API is properly mapped
  - Expected: `postalCode: "72-600"`
  - Check API response structure for zip_code/postal_code field
  - **Implementation:** Now uses `store.address.zip` (primary field in PinMeTo API)

- [ ] **4. Add aggregateRating from reviews data** ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED - Pending API Update (2025-10-10)
  - Calculate from reviews array
  - Add to schema:
    ```json
    "aggregateRating": {
      "@type": "AggregateRating",
      "ratingValue": "4.5",
      "reviewCount": "127",
      "bestRating": "5",
      "worstRating": "1"
    }
    ```
  - Use actual review data from API or test data
  - **Implementation Status:** Code exists (`calculateAggregateRating()` helper at lines 580-594) but not executing because:
    - `REVIEWS_DATA` is defined inside `initializeApp()` function (line 1339)
    - Schema is generated before reviews data is available
  - **TODO**: Once API provides `store.reviews` array, this will work automatically
  - **Alternative**: Move `REVIEWS_DATA` to global scope for testing with demo data

- [x] **5. Add hasMap property with Google Maps URL** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-09)
  - Add property: `"hasMap": "https://maps.google.com/maps?cid=1884650547752002378"`
  - Or use: `"hasMap": "https://www.google.com/maps/dir/?api=1&destination=LAT,LONG"`
  - Already have coordinates, just need to add property
  - **Implementation:** Prefers `store.network.google.link` from API, fallback to generated URL

- [ ] **6. Add parent Organization schema for brand** ‚è∏Ô∏è DEFERRED - Pending API Update (2025-10-10)
  - Create separate script tag or nested structure
  - Schema:
    ```json
    {
      "@context": "https://schema.org",
      "@type": "Organization",
      "name": "RTV EURO AGD",
      "url": "https://www.euro.com.pl",
      "logo": "https://www.euro.com.pl/logo.png",
      "sameAs": [
        "https://www.facebook.com/rtveuroagd",
        "https://www.instagram.com/rtveuroagd"
      ]
    }
    ```
  - Link LocalBusiness to Organization with `"parentOrganization"` property
  - **Implementation Status:** Code exists (lines 758-794) but not executing because:
    - Logic requires: `brandName !== storeName` OR `store.brandUrl` OR `store.brandLogo`
    - Current: "RTV EURO AGD" has brandName === storeName, no brandUrl/brandLogo in API
  - **TODO**: API should provide `store.brandUrl`, `store.brandLogo`, and `store.brandSocialMedia[]`
  - **Alternative**: Adjust logic to always create Organization for known brands

- [x] **7. Added enhanced LocalBusiness properties** ‚úÖ COMPLETED (2025-10-09)
  - description (from store.longDescription)
  - areaServed (City schema with store city)
  - priceRange, paymentAccepted, currenciesAccepted (configurable via data attributes)

**Validation:**
- [ ] Test with: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results (requires public URL)
- [x] Test with: https://validator.schema.org/ ‚úÖ **PASSED: 0 ERRORS, 0 WARNINGS** (2025-10-10)
- [x] Check: All required LocalBusiness properties present ‚úÖ
- [x] Check: No errors or warnings in validation ‚úÖ

    ]
    ```
  - Source from: `store.images[]` array in API response
  - Fallback: Use default if no images available
  - **TODO**: API should provide `store.images[]` with multiple high-quality store photos

- [ ] **11. Fix phone number consistency** ‚è∏Ô∏è PENDING API
  - Standardize format: "+48 85 585 58 55" (international format)
  - Structured data: `"telephone": "+48855855855"`
  - Display: "+48 85 585 58 55" (with spaces for readability)
  - Tel link: `tel:+48855855855` (no spaces, with country code)
  - Ensure: All three match the same phone number

## Implementation Notes

### Configuration Strategy
Make new features configurable via data attributes:
```html
<div id="pmt-store-landing-page-container"
     data-enable-faq="true"
     data-enable-reviews-schema="true"
     data-enable-services-section="true"
     data-show-about-section="true"
     data-price-range="$$"
     data-currencies-accepted="PLN"
     data-payment-methods="Cash, Credit Card, Debit Card">
</div>
```

### API Data Requirements
Ensure API provides (or add defaults):
- Postal code (currently missing)
- Multiple store images
- Review data with ratings
- Business categories
- Payment methods
- Service area information

### Backward Compatibility
- Keep existing functionality intact
- Add new features as optional enhancements
- Maintain existing data attribute support
- Default to current behavior if new attributes not set

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize additional JavaScript execution
- Load structured data asynchronously if large
- Don't block page rendering with schema generation
- Consider splitting FAQ schema into separate file if large
